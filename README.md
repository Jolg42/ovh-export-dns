ovh-export-dns-zone for OVH.com REST API
===================

This is a basic script (My first Ruby script ;)

His goal is to backup all the DNS Records, because OVH has no built-in functionnality for saving DNS Zones.

The script calls the OVH REST API for each domain you manage and put the DNS Zone into a .txt

Feel free to contribute, if I have time, I will add a file versioning process if DNS Zone is different.

Happy DNS !
